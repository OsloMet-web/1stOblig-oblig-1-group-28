    <p>Back in France, I study at an engineering school named INSA, in Toulouse. 
        What I really love about my school is the fact that there are residences on campus. 
        I just have to walk for 2 minutes to go to class. This is amazing because I don't have to 
        wake up early and take public transportation. This is also very convenient to meet friends 
        and party because we all live on campus.

    <p>In France I'm an engineering student at ESIEE-Paris, and what I 
        love most about my school is everything that happens outside of classes.
        Firstly, the camaraderie among students is amazing.
        We're like a big family, always ready to help and support each other.
        Secondly, there are so many clubs and groups to join. 
        Whether you're into building robots or starting a business, 
        you'll find a club that fits your interests. It's a great way to learn and make friends.
        Lastly, we know how to have fun. 
        Students throw awesome parties and organize galas. 
        It's a great break from studying and a chance to celebrate together.

    <p>In France, I study IT engineering at a school named INSA. What I like the most about my school
       is that we have to take a sport course each semester. We also have the choice of the sport we want
       to practice, among a long list of different ones. During the week, I always look forward this 
       training class. In my opinion, it's important to be physicaly active. It helps relieving stress and
       tension. It permits feeling part of a group by making new friends. Finally, for me, it helps
       achieving goals and developping self-improvement.
