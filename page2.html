    <p>Back in France, I study at an engineering school named INSA, in Toulouse. 
        What I really love about my school is the fact that there are residences on campus. 
        I just have to walk for 2 minutes to go to class. This is amazing because I don't have to 
        wake up early and take public transportation. This is also very convenient to meet friends 
        and party because we all live on campus.
